- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @thphuc2311
  
Hi. This is my open - source DIY project.
In case you just want to take a look to my code, click to PersonalClock_CustomMenu.ino to view code directly.

In other hand, you want to Edit or Re-Create this project as your custom project. You can download 2 folder zip as material.

I have attached the link to my easyEDA domain in PCB_Design.txt
You can preview and clone as your project and then Customize the design (schematic and PCB layout) as you want.

In PCB design, I have some issue, defect that maybe affect to normal working of the clock. Mostly about external power supply and battery charger module. It will not work properly together as my purpose in some case.
In all of situation, the clock work in normal state.

I will update some image as reference or preview how the clock look like.

Hope you like my project.
